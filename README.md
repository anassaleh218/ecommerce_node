# Ecommerce Node.js Application

This project is an **ecommerce platform** built using **Node.js** and the **Express framework**. It provides a robust backend for handling user authentication, product management, and order processing. The application integrates with **MongoDB** as the database, using **Mongoose** for database interaction, and implements essential features like file uploads and input validation.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The primary runtime for building the backend of this application.
- **Express.js**: A lightweight framework used to create a robust REST API structure.
- **MongoDB**: The NoSQL database used to store user, product, and order information.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library used to interact with MongoDB, providing schema-based models.
- **JWT**: Used for user authentication and session management, ensuring secure and stateless authentication.
- **Joi**: A powerful validation library used to validate incoming data (e.g., user registration, product creation).
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads, particularly for uploading product images.
